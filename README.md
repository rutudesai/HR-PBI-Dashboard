In this Power BI Dashboard, I worked on :

1) Getting text data to Power BI
2) Transforming data using Power Query as an Extract, Transform and Load Tool.
3) Manipulated data to create measures and fields accordingly to get desired results.
4) Used Conditional Formatting to find duplicates in different columns of sheet.
5) Leveraged the power of different visuals from Power BI and created a wonderful Dashboard.
5) Used Page Navigator to cretate buttons to go through different pages on the Dashboard easily.
6) Created conditional columns as per the requiremnets in power query.
7) Merged Data to get appropriate results.
